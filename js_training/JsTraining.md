## Quick Overview HTML

******

###What is HTML?

HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language 
used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting 
of tags enclosed in angle brackets

******

### How does it work?


HTML consists different type of elements which are called tags. Some of those tags are:

******

"DIV" which defines the contaner. It stands for division. 
 
"P" Which is a paragraph container and stands for parapraph

And many more…

******

Each time you insert a new tag it acts like a box
It will take a new line and will be under one another unless you specify it with javascript. 

But not all of the html tags are for division and space control. Some of them are about making the text italic or bold. Those tags do not take space just modify the content within the tag or modify the document itself. 

******

### What does HTML document consist of?

******

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

******

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```


This tag defines that this document is an html document and it also specifies implicitly the version number of this html document. In this case it is HTML 5

******

```html
<html>
</html>
```

This tag contains html related tags within it. It takes to main elements. __<head>__ and __<body>__

******

```html
<head></head>
```

Head tag contains the information about the web page like the __Title__ and the required files for this page, like the __CSS__, and the __JavaScript__ files.

******

```html
<body></body>
```
The Body tag is where the content resides. Basically it contains all of the content you would like to show to the user.
